# hcInt - HashCat web INTerface
![hcInt](images/image01.png)

## Info

This project provides a web based frontend for hashcat. The idea is to allow you to use a more powerful computer to crack hashes while doing CTFs or similar. 

The idea came about when I was tired of copying/pasting a hash for a CTF into a VM I have with GPU passthrough over an SSH session. With this, you can open hcint in another tab, copy/paste directly into the hcint site and watch the command output.

hcInt can be hosted on a server with GPU passthrough or on your desktop PC.

Thanks to:
- [Lycan](https://github.com/1yc4n0rn0t) for input on the web interface
- [TylerR1](https://github.com/trendingtrades) for suggested functionaliy upgrades

#### Future enhancements:
- add a timer
- add a stop button to halt the hashcat process
- add additional (most used or all) hash types
- ~~implement wordlist selection~~
- ~~implement wordlist downloader~~
- change default runlevel to INFO and add DEBUG runlevel argument (-d)
- hashcat error checking
